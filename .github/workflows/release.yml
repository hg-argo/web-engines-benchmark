# Since this workflow uses `@game-ci/unity` Action to generate Unity builds,
# you must setup some secret variables before running this workflow:
# - `UNITY_LICENSE` (if using a personal license):
#   - Log in Unity Hub with the account used for CI
#   - Create the license, and locate the file on your machine:
#     - Windows: C:\ProgramData\Unity\Unity_lic.ulf
#     - Mac: /Library/Application Support/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf
#     - Linux: ~/.local/share/unity3d/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf
#   - Copy the content into a secret variable `UNITY_LICENSE`
# - `UNITY_SERIAL` (if using a professional license)
#   - Go to subscriptons page (https://id.unity.com/subscriptions)
#   - Copy the "Serial Number" of the license into a secret variable `UNITY_SERIAL`
#   - Replace all occurrences of `UNITY_LICENSE` by `UNITY_SERIAL` in this workflow script
# - `UNITY_EMAIL`: The email used for the CI account
# - `UNITY_PASSWORD`: The password used for the CI account
#
# More info: https://game.ci/docs/github/getting-started/
